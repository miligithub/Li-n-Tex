	% 3. Does not usually contain citations, 
	% 4. Do not repeat the thesis title, and
	% 5. Each paragraph should be indented.	
	\begin{abstract}
		The abstract is a concise, one to three sentence statement of the thesis problem, a brief description consisting of no more than a few sentences describing the research method or design, and a report of the major findings and conclusions.

		The abstract submitted online at the time of thesis submission should be the same as the abstract inside the thesis. ProQuest continues to publish print indexes that have maximum abstract lengths of 150 words for Masters and 350 words for PhDs. Abstracts exceeding these limits will be truncated in the print indexes so it may be wise to work within those word limits in most cases.

	%%==================Acknowledgements===============
	% Comment the section out if you don't need it 
	\begin{acknowledgment}
		This optional page includes a paragraph or two acknowledging and thanking your

	%%==================Dedication===============
	% Comment the section out if you don't need it 
	\begin{dedication}
		Dedication Page: A dedication page is optional and not frequently included in a thesis. However, occasionally the thesis writer wants to dedicate the document to a professional colleague, friend, or relative. A dedication typically expresses gratitude for someone's support. If a dedication page is included, it is placed at the end of the front matter section, following the acknowledgments. Typically, a dedication page has no title, it simply states, e.g., "For my father." Roman numeral page numbering continues on the dedication page.

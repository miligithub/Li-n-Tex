	\begin{abstract}
		The abstract is a concise, one to three sentence statement of the thesis problem, a brief description consisting of no more than a few sentences describing the research method or design, and a report of the major findings and conclusions.

		The abstract submitted online at the time of thesis submission should be the same as the abstract inside the thesis. ProQuest continues to publish print indexes that have maximum abstract lengths of 150 words for Masters and 350 words for PhDs. Abstracts exceeding these limits will be truncated in the print indexes so it may be wise to work within those word limits in most cases.
